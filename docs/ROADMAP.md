# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and future direction for the project.

### Short-Term Goals

-   **Implement Advanced Simulation Logic**: Add a worker process or cron job on the backend to handle build timers. This will allow upgrades to progress in real-time, even when the user is offline.
-   **Complete UI/UX Polish**: Refine the user interface, add animations for a better user experience, and ensure full responsiveness on all major screen sizes.
-   **Error Handling and Feedback**: Improve frontend and backend error handling to provide clearer feedback to the user (e.g., "Not enough gold," "All builders are busy").

### Mid-Term Goals

-   **Expand Economy**: Introduce new resources (e.g., "Dark Elixir") and a market system for trading or purchasing resources.
-   **Data Visualization**: Add a dedicated dashboard with charts and graphs to visualize user progress, resource generation over time, and upgrade efficiency.
-   **Social Features**: Implement basic social features, such as viewing other users' bases or a leaderboard.

### Long-Term Goals

-   **Attack/Defense Simulation**: Introduce a simple combat mechanic where users can simulate attacks on a base to test its defensive layout.
-   **Gamification**: Add achievements, daily quests, and rewards to increase user engagement.
-   **Full TypeScript Migration**: Convert the entire JavaScript codebase (frontend and backend) to TypeScript for improved type safety and maintainability.
